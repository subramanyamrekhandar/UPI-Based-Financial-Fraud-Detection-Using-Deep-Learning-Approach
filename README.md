# UPI Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive fraud detection system designed to analyze and predict fraudulent transactions in UPI systems. We focus on identifying suspicious patterns and using machine learning models to predict fraud. Additionally, an interactive dashboard is built to visualize the findings and allow users to explore the data dynamically.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore the distribution of fraudulent transactions across various transaction types.
- **Fraud Prediction**: Use machine learning (Random Forest) to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Visualization**: Create insightful plots to visualize fraud trends over time, by transaction type, and more.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built using Streamlit, the dashboard allows users to filter and explore transactions interactively.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive modeling
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard for data exploration
